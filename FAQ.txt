What is a Spring Bean?

A "Spring Bean" is simply a Java object.

When Java objects are created by the Spring Container, then Spring refers to them as "Spring Beans".

Spring Beans are created from normal Java classes .... just like Java objects.

In summary, whenever you see "Spring Bean", just think Java object. :-)

Why do we specify the Coach interface in getBean()?

For example:

Coach theCoach = context.getBean("myCoach", Coach.class); 

---

Answer

When we pass the interface to the method, behind the scenes Spring will cast the object for you.

context.getBean("myCoach", Coach.class)  

However, there are some slight differences than normal casting.

From the Spring docs:

Behaves the same as getBean(String), but provides a measure of type safety by throwing a BeanNotOfRequiredTypeException if the bean is not of the required type. This means that ClassCastException can't be thrown on casting the result correctly, as can happen with getBean(String).
